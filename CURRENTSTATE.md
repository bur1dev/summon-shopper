# Summon Shopper App - Development Log

!!! IMPORTANT !!!
!!! FOR ALL THE DEVELOPMENT SETUP, CHECK DEVSETUP.md !!!

This file documents the current state of the shopper app functionality.

## ‚úÖ MOBILE/DESKTOP DNA ISSUE - COMPLETELY RESOLVED (2025-07-05)

### üéâ Both Mobile and Desktop Apps Fully Functional

**Status**: ‚úÖ BOTH PLATFORMS WORKING - All DNA mismatch issues resolved

#### PROBLEM WAS: Configuration Naming Inconsistencies
**Root Cause Identified**: When copying configuration from `summon-shopper-app` (broken scaffolded directory), all references still pointed to `summon-shopper-app` instead of `summon-shopper` (working directory).

**The Issue**:
- Configuration files referenced `summon-shopper-app.happ` but app was building `summon-shopper.happ`
- Path mismatches between configuration and actual file locations
- Desktop worked by accident, mobile failed due to stricter path resolution

#### SOLUTION APPLIED - SYSTEMATIC NAMING FIXES:

**üîß Fixed All Configuration References**:
- `package.json` ‚Üí Updated all `summon-shopper-app.happ` references to `summon-shopper.happ`
- `happ.yaml` ‚Üí Changed name from `summon-shopper-app` to `summon-shopper`
- `web-happ.yaml` ‚Üí Updated name and happ references
- `tauri.conf.json` ‚Üí Changed productName to `summon-shopper`
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` ‚Üí Updated package name
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` ‚Üí Fixed all string references and file paths
- `src-tauri/build.rs` ‚Üí Updated happ file reference
- `.github/workflows/release-tauri-app.yaml` ‚Üí Fixed artifact references

**üîß Symlink Architecture Established**:
- `summon-shopper/dnas/cart` ‚Üí symlink to `/home/bur1/Holochain/summon-dnas/cart`
- Shared DNA source code between summon and summon-shopper apps
- Each app builds its own WASM files to its own target directory
- DNA configuration points to correct relative paths

**üîß Build Process Optimized**:
- summon-shopper builds zomes and copies WASM files to summon target for compatibility
- Consistent DNA configuration works for both apps
- Proper symlink structure maintains shared source

#### RESULTS:
- **‚úÖ Desktop**: Full functionality, can create/view/manage fake orders
- **‚úÖ Mobile Android**: Full functionality, can create/view/manage fake orders  
- **‚úÖ DNA Consistency**: Both platforms use identical DNA with correct zome definitions
- **‚úÖ Barcode Scanner**: Ready for testing on mobile
- **‚úÖ Build Process**: Consistent and reliable across platforms
- **‚úÖ Symlink Architecture**: Proper shared DNA source code management

#### CURRENT APP CAPABILITIES:
- **‚úÖ Fake Data Generation**: Both platforms can create realistic test orders
- **‚úÖ Order Management**: View, filter, and manage customer orders
- **‚úÖ Product Details**: Detailed product information and UPC data
- **‚úÖ Barcode Scanning**: Camera-based UPC validation (mobile ready)
- **‚úÖ Cross-Platform**: Identical functionality on desktop and mobile

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PROFILES FUNCTIONALITY - TEMPORARILY DISABLED (2025-07-05)

### üö® Android Platform Issue: DanglingZomeDependency

**Status**: Profiles removed to maintain Android compatibility

**Issue**: `DanglingZomeDependency("profiles_integrity", "profiles")` error occurs specifically on Android platform when profiles zomes are included in DNA.

**Investigation Results**:
- **‚úÖ Desktop**: Profiles work perfectly with no issues
- **‚ùå Android**: Confirmed Holochain platform bug, not configuration issue
- **‚úÖ All Versions**: HDK 0.5.3, HDI 0.6.3, profiles 0.501.0 - all correctly aligned
- **‚úÖ Configuration**: All settings correct per working examples

#### CURRENT SOLUTION:
**Profiles Temporarily Removed** to enable full Android development:
- DNA contains only cart zomes (no profiles)
- All profile-related workspace dependencies removed
- Complete restoration process documented in `PROFILESSETUP.md`

#### IMPACT:
- **‚úÖ Android Development**: Fully enabled without profiles
- **‚úÖ Barcode Scanner**: Can be tested and developed on mobile
- **‚úÖ Core Functionality**: All cart/order features working perfectly
- **‚ùå Profile Names**: Display "John Smith" placeholder instead of real names
- **‚ùå Avatars**: Generic avatars instead of user profiles

#### FUTURE RESTORATION:
**Complete restoration plan available** in `PROFILESSETUP.md`:
- All profiles zome source code preserved in `summon-dnas`
- Workspace dependencies documented for easy restoration
- UI components ready for profiles
- **Waiting on**: Holochain community fix for Android DanglingZomeDependency

## ‚úÖ BARCODE SCANNER IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETED (2025-07-02)

### Scanner Functionality - WORKING ‚úÖ
**Status**: Full barcode scanning implementation complete and mobile-ready

**Features**:
- **Camera Integration**: Web camera access using @zxing/library v0.21.3
- **UPC Validation**: Scanned barcodes compared against order product UPCs
- **Real-time Feedback**: Success/error messages with visual indicators
- **Mobile Ready**: Works in mobile browsers and Tauri mobile apps

**User Flow**:
- Order List ‚Üí Order Detail ‚Üí Click Product ‚Üí Product Detail ‚Üí Scan Button ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Validation

**Testing Status**:
- **‚úÖ Desktop**: Works with laptop webcam for development/testing
- **‚úÖ Mobile**: Ready for testing on Android device with camera

## ‚úÖ UPC DATA INTEGRATION - COMPLETED (2025-07-02)

### Goal: UPC Support Throughout Data Pipeline ‚úÖ
**Status**: UPC data flows from JSON ‚Üí DHT ‚Üí Cart ‚Üí Checkout ‚Üí Shopper App

**Data Flow Architecture**:
```
JSON Product Data (has "upc": "0002100000728")
    ‚Üì DHTSyncService.ts (extract upc field)
DHT Product Entry (Product.upc)
    ‚Üì CartBusinessService.ts (include upc in cart)
Cart Item (CartItem.upc)
    ‚Üì Checkout process (preserve upc)
CartProduct Entry (CartProduct.upc) 
    ‚Üì get_all_available_orders
Shopper App Orders (with UPC embedded)
    ‚Üì Barcode Scanner
Compare scanned UPC vs embedded UPCs
```

**Implementation Complete**:
- ‚úÖ Backend DNA: UPC fields added to Product and CartProduct structs
- ‚úÖ Frontend summon: UPC extraction and cart integration
- ‚úÖ Frontend shopper: UPC available for scanning validation
- ‚úÖ End-to-end flow: UPC preserved through entire data pipeline

## ‚úÖ CART CHECKOUT/RETURN FLOW - WORKING (2025-07-02)

### Dual-Link System Working Correctly

**Checkout Process**:
1. Creates `CheckedOutCart` entry with "processing" status
2. Creates 2 links: Customer privacy + Shopper discovery
3. Orders appear in shopper app for fulfillment

**Return to Shopping**:
1. Updates cart status to "returned"
2. Deletes both links completely
3. Order disappears from shopper discovery

**Current DNA Hash**: `uhC0kB_RFApHzMsRgiAcrW_DjUvBkFSRJE9IIDDXi6e7hl38ogsSw`
